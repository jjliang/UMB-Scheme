/* ALIGNMENT is the byte-boundary on which double's must be aligned
   in memory.  This constant is necessary for insuring the proper
   alignment of Scheme objects in the Heap (architecture.c).
   For example, on the Vax structs can be aligned on any 1-byte
   boundary, so ALIGNMENT=1.  On the other hand, on the Sun Sparc
   (and most RISC machines) structs must be aligned on 8-byte
   boundaries, so ALIGNMENT=8.  If you don't know, then 8 is safest
   (but will cause a little more fragmentation); better safe than sorry.
